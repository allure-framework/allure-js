## Installation

```bash
npm i -D vitest allure-vitest
```

or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D vitest allure-vitest
```

## Configuration

Add instance of the reporter to the [`reporters` section](https://vitest.dev/config/#reporters) of your Vitest config:

```js
import AllureReporter from "allure-vitest/reporter";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    // add setup file to be able to use Allure API via `this.allure` in your tests and to get test plan support
    setupFiles: ["allure-vitest/setup"],
    reporters: [
      // do not forget to keep the "default" if you want to see something in the console
      "default",
      new AllureReporter({
        links: [
          {
            type: "issue",
            urlTemplate: "https://example.org/issue/%s",
          },
          {
            type: "tms",
            urlTemplate: "https://example.org/task/%s",
          },
        ],
        resultsDir: "./allure-results",
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

## Reporter options

Some reporter settings can set by following options:

| Option     | Description                                           | Default            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| resultsDir | Path to results folder                                | `./allure-results` |
| links      | Links templates to make runtime methods calls simpler | `undefined`        |

## API

If you use setup file shipped by the integration, use `this.allure` to get access
to Allure Runtime API:

```js
import { test } from "vitest";

test("sample test", async () => {
  await allure.label("foo", "bar");
});
```

Additionally, you can call Allure Runtime API methods directly passing the
context argument to the method:

```js
import { test } from "vitest";
import * as allure from "allure-vitest";

test("sample test", async (context) => {
  await allure.label(context, "foo", "bar");
});
```

## Selective test execution

Allure allow you to execute only a subset of tests. This is useful when you want 
to run only a specific test or a group of tests.

It works out of the box if you add `allure-vitest/setup` to your `setupFiles` 
config option.

Allure will read `ALLURE_TESTPLAN_PATH` environment variable and read testplan 
from the specified file.

## Passing metadata from test title

You also can pass allure metadata from test title.
This is useful when you need to set allureId for the tests with failing before hooks. Just add `@allure.id={idValue}` for the allureId or `@allure.label.{labelName}={labelValue}` for other types of labels.

```ts
import { test } from "vitest";

test("test with allureId @allure.id=256", () => {});
test("tst with severity @allure.label.severity=critical", () => {});
test("test with epic @allure.label.epic=login", () => {});
test("test with strangeLabel @allure.label.strangeLabel=strangeValue", () => {});
```

> **Warning**
> Note that changing title can cause creating new testcases in history.
> To fix this please add `@allure.id={yourTestCaseId}` to the test name if you passing allure metadata from test title
